To execute the program, simply run it using the following command:\n./program\nNote that you need to have GCC installed on your system for this to work.

Linking errors: These occur when there are issues with linking the object code files together to create an executable file. This can happen if the object code files have different versions of libraries or if they are not properly linked.\n3. Runtime errors: These occur during program execution and can include segmentation faults, stack overflows, or division by zero. These errors can be difficult to debug because they only occur when the program is running.\n4. Logic errors: These occur when the program logic is incorrect, resulting in unexpected behavior or incorrect output. These errors can be difficult to detect because they may not produce any visible errors during execution.\n5. Performance issues: These occur when the program runs slowly or uses excessive resources such as memory or CPU time. This can happen due to inefficient algorithms or poor programming practices.",

Download the installation package from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or use your preferred package manager to install it.\n2. Once installed, open VSCode and create a new project or open an existing one.\n3. To debug code in VSCode, you'll need to install a debugger for the language you're using. For example, if you're working with Python, you can install the Python extension and the pdb debugger.\n4. To use the character interface (command line) on Linux, open a terminal window by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T or searching for \"Terminal\" in your application menu.\n5. In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your project using the cd command followed by the path to the directory. For example:\n   ```\n   $ cd /path/to/project\n   ```\n6. To run your code from the terminal, use the appropriate command for your language.

        "answer": "Both tools have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on personal preferences and specific needs.\nNotepad is a simple text editor that allows you to create and edit plain text files. It's lightweight, easy to use, and doesn't require any installation or setup. However, it lacks advanced features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools.\nVSCode, on the other hand, is a more powerful development environment that provides a rich set of features for coding, debugging, and collaboration. It supports multiple programming languages, has an extensive library of extensions, and allows you to work with Git repositories directly from the interface. However, it requires installation and setup, and can be resource-intensive on older computers.\nIn summary, if you're just starting out with coding or need a simple text editor for occasional use, Notepad may be a better choice. If you're a professional developer or need more advanced features, VSCode is the way to go.",

These skills are essential for achieving a very long way towards being able to write and design algorithms and programs. By saving your own solutions to exercises in folders or directories, you can review them later and see how you did. This practice is advised as it helps improve your performance in the subject.",

To obtain a passing grade based on continuous monitoring of classes, you must achieve a threshold of at least 16 points on the final exam AND have a total number of points >= 50. Since laboratory exercises carry a maximum of 30 points and have no point threshold, it is very important to work continuously and regularly access laboratory exercises in order to accumulate enough points to pass.",

Therefore, to determine if you passed based on continuous monitoring of classes, we need to calculate your total number of points.\nYour total number of points is calculated by adding up the points obtained in the laboratory exercises during the continuous monitoring of classes (23) and the points obtained on written knowledge tests during the examination period (0). Since there are no written knowledge tests for you to take, we cannot add any points from those tests.\nTo achieve a passing grade based on continuous monitoring of classes, you must have achieved a threshold of at least 16 (out of 40 possible) points on the final exam and a total number of points >= 50. Since your final exam score is 23, you did not meet the point threshold for the final exam.\nTherefore, based on continuous monitoring of classes, you did not pass.",

Once you consider your solution correct, print its final value in the window with accompanying text. Set a breakpoint on the command before which you want to stop the execution of the program by pressing the left mouse button at the beginning of the corresponding line. After compiling, the program starts and stops at the breakpoint. By hovering the mouse over the name of the variable, you can get an insight into its value.",
