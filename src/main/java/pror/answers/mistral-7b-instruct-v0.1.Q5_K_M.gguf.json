Runtime errors occur during the execution of the program and can cause it to crash or behave unexpectedly. Linker errors occur when there are problems with the linking process, such as missing or incorrect library files. It's important to thoroughly test the program with different test data to ensure that it is working correctly before executing it on a larger scale.",

You can then use the debugger's\n    features to step through your code, inspect variables, and diagnose errors.

It is recommended to use an indentation of 3 letter spaces. Additionally, you need to change the tab width in the VSC settings for correct formatting.",

These tools check for syntax errors, semantic errors, runtime errors, and other issues that may affect the correctness of the solution. The process involves several steps:\n\n1. Syntax checking: This step checks the program code for syntax errors such as missing semicolons, parentheses, or braces. It also checks for proper indentation and formatting. If any syntax errors are found, the system will display an error message indicating the location of the error.\n2. Semantic checking: This step checks the program code for semantic errors such as undefined variables, incorrect data types, or incorrect function calls. It also checks for proper use of control structures like loops and conditionals. If any semantic errors are found, the system will display an error message indicating the location of the error.\n3. Runtime checking: This step runs the program code and tests it with different input data to check for runtime errors such as division by zero or array out of bounds. It also checks for proper use of memory allocation and deallocation. If any runtime errors are runtime errors are runtime errors are runtime errors are runtime",
