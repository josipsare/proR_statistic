    "answer": "A compiler takes human-readable source code written in a programming language and converts it into machine code that can be executed by a computer. It checks for syntax errors and generates object files (with the extension .o) that cannot yet be executed because they do not yet exist in their final form.\nA linker links these object files with libraries containing standard functions and program files, merging them all together into an executable file that can be run on the computer. It also resolves any external references (references to functions or variables from other object code and program files) and ensures that they are properly linked in the final executable file.",

Install MinGW using the following command:\n   ```\n   brew install mingw-w64\n   ```\n4. After installation, you can verify that MinGW is installed by running the following command:\n   ```\n   mingw-w64 --version\n   ```\n5. If the installation was successful, you should see the version number of MinGW displayed in the Terminal window.\nNote: This method only installs the MinGW compiler toolchain for x86_64 architecture (also known as 64-bit or amd64). To use MinGW with other architectures, you may need to follow a different installation process.",

In the \"Debug Configurations\" window that appears, select the configuration for your programming language (e.g., C/C++).\n3. Set any necessary breakpoints by clicking on the line number where you want the program to pause execution.\n4. Click the \"Start Debugging\" button (the green arrow again) or press F5 to begin debugging.\n5. The debugger will now step through your code, pausing at each breakpoint and allowing you to examine variables and other program state.\n6. Use the debugger's controls (e.g., \"Step Over\", \"Step Into\") to navigate through your code and identify any issues or unexpected behavior.\n7.

It also supports various programming languages and frameworks through extensions. However, it may require more system resources and have a steeper learning curve compared to Notepad.\n\nNotepad, on the other hand, is a simple text editor that does not offer advanced features like syntax highlighting or debugging. It is lightweight and requires fewer system resources, making it suitable for basic text editing tasks. However, it may not be ideal for complex programming tasks as it lacks some essential tools.\n\nIn this course, students have the freedom to choose between VSCode and Notepad/Notepad++, but they should note that regardless of which option they select, they will still have access to the necessary tools and resources required to complete the assignments. Ultimately, it is up to the student's preference and comfort level of course requirements to what they should be aware of course requirements to choose the specific needs to considerations",

The use of indentation, spacing, and line breaks improves the overall structure and organization of the code, making it easier to follow the flow of execution.

Before submitting the solution to Edgar, it is necessary to compile the program using a C compiler (e.g. GCC). This process converts the human-readable source code into machine code that can be executed by the computer.\nAfter compiling the program, you can run it and test its functionality with different input data. If the program works correctly for all test cases, you can submit the compiled binary file (usually with the extension .exe) to Edgar.\nIn Edgar, the submitted binary file is executed with a set of test inputs provided by the system. The output of the program is compared with the expected result, and points are awarded based on the correctness of the solution. If the program produces incorrect results for any test case, it receives a lower score or fails the task altogether.\nIn summary, the checks with program tasks in Edgar involve compiling, testing, and submitting the binary file to the system for evaluation. The accuracy and efficiency of the program are assessed based on a critical factors in terms of its performance indicators of",

This system allows you to communicate with teaching staff about issues related to tests, such as preparing for labs, mid-term exams, final exams, etc. If you have any doubts or concerns about a specific task, you can submit a question through this system. The use of the ticketing system while writing a check is described in section 3.1 of the Edgar User Manual. By using this system, you can view your messages related to exam questions using the My tickets menu options, which allows for subsequent review of teaching staff answers if necessary. This feature is useful when the answer cannot be provided quickly due to the duration of the check.",

If you do not meet these requirements, your grade will be determined based on the following scale:\n- [87.5, 100] - grade 5\n- [75, 87.5) - grade 4\n- [62.5, 75) - grade 3\n- [50, 62.5) - grade 2\nUnfortunately, the information provided does not specify a point threshold for the midterm exam.

If you consider your solution correct, print its final value in the window along with accompanying text at the end of the program. While running the program, set a breakpoint on the command where you want to stop the execution by clicking the left mouse button at the beginning of the corresponding line.
