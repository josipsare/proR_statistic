This can happen if the object code files have different versions of libraries or if they are not properly linked.\n3. Runtime errors: These occur during program execution and can include segmentation faults, stack overflows, or division by zero. These errors can be difficult to debug because they only occur when the program is running.\n4. Logic errors: These occur when the program logic is incorrect, resulting in unexpected behavior or incorrect output. These errors can be difficult to detect because they may not produce any visible errors during execution.\n5. Performance issues: These occur when the program runs slowly or uses excessive resources such as memory or CPU time. This can happen due to inefficient algorithms or poor programming practices.",

    "question": "Give me the basics of using a debugger in Visual Studio Code.",
    "answer": "To use a debugger in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:\n1. Install the Debugger for Node.js extension from the Marketplace.\n2. Add a launch configuration to your project's `launch.json` file. This tells the debugger which files to run and how to run them.\n3. Set breakpoints in your code by clicking on the left margin or pressing Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows, Linux) or Command + Shift + P (macOS).\n4. Start debugging by clicking the \"Debug\" button or pressing F5. The debugger will pause at the first breakpoint and allow you to step through your code line by line.\n5. Use the debugger's features such as stepping over, stepping into, and setting watches to help diagnose issues in your code.\n6. When you're done debugging, press F5 again or click the \"Stop Debugging\" button to exit debug mode.\nFor more information on using the basics and detailed instructions and detailed instructions and detailed instructions and detailed instructions and detailed instructions and detailed instructions and detailed instructions and detailed instructions and detailed instructions and detailed instructions and detailed instructions and detailed instructions and detailed instructions, see:",

It's lightweight, easy to use, and doesn't require any installation or setup. However, it lacks advanced features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools.\nVSCode, on the other hand, is a more powerful development environment that provides a rich set of features for coding, debugging, and collaboration. It supports multiple programming languages, has an extensive library of extensions, and allows you to work with Git repositories directly from the interface. However, it requires installation and setup, and can be resource-intensive on older computers.\nIn summary, if you're just starting out with coding or need a simple text editor for occasional use, Notepad may be a better choice. If you're a professional developer or need more advanced features, VSCode is the way to go.",

Therefore, to determine if you passed based on continuous monitoring of classes, we need to calculate your total number of points.\nYour total number of points is calculated by adding up the points obtained in the laboratory exercises during the continuous monitoring of classes (23) and the points obtained on written knowledge tests during the examination period (0). Since there are no written knowledge tests for you to take, we cannot add any points from those tests.\nTo achieve a passing grade based on continuous monitoring of classes, you must have achieved a threshold of at least 16 (out of 40 possible) points on the final exam and a total number of points >= 50. Since your final exam score is 23, you did not meet the point threshold for the final exam.\nTherefore, based on continuous monitoring of classes, you did not pass.",

Once you consider your solution correct, print its final value in the window with accompanying text. Set a breakpoint on the command before which you want to stop the execution of the program by pressing the left mouse button at the beginning of the corresponding line. After compiling, the program starts and stops at the breakpoint. By hovering the mouse over the name of the variable, you can get an insight into its value.",
